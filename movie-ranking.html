<h1> The best movies according to Amina :)</h1>

<h2>My top three movies of all time:</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Immaculate</h3>
<p>“Immaculate” feels like both a throwback to another era of Italian horror and a timely commentary on woman’s bodily autonomy, 
    but it can’t match the flair of the former and lacks the thematic thrust to convey anything resonant about the latter.. I kept wanting Russell Crowe to ride in on his “Pope’s Exorcist” Vespa and whisk her off to a better movie.</p>

<h3>Mean girls</h3>
<p>this is my favorite movie. i just love it. very quotable ahh!</p>

<h3>Devil wears Prada</h3>
<p>Everything about this movie is *chef's kiss*. The cast, the costumes and the acting! just amazing! I rewatch it at least two times a month!</p>
